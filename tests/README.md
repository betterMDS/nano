NANO TESTS
----------

To run the tests, go to a command line, navigate to the /nano directory and type:
```bash
node nano.js ./tests/test.js
```
This will run the "test" module and effectively copy the "copyme" folder structure
to a "deploy-v8" folder structure. If you change the version number in dev.html, you will get a differently versioned deploy folder.
